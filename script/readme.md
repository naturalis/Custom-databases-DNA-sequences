# Scripts

Brief description of each script.


## custom_databases.py
Using an export from the Dutch Species Register (NSR) with a full taxonomic breakdown, including synonyms and expected species, running the script allows for its list of species to be compared against matching genera extracted using BOLD's Public Data Portal API. Filterting to Dutch records only, it writes matching/non-matching sequence data to their allocated files.


## custom_databases.Rmd
Determine the distribution of species collected (against a reference), and presents an overview of the contribution and significance of various parameters stored within the obtained public sequence data relating to the quality thereof.

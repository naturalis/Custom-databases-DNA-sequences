Current version of the Custom Databases script uses an export ('testfile.csv') from the Dutch Species Register for testing purposes. Running the script allows this list of species to be compared against matching genera extracted using BOLD's Public Data Portal API.
Filterting to Dutch records only and writing matching/non-matching sequence data to their allocated files.

Soon using an export with a full taxonomic breakdown, including synonyms and expected species, a more accurate custom database can be created and updated incrementially containing new or changes to the public sequence data of interest.
